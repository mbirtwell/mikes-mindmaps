            Press the big green button above to create a mind map.
            Share the URL of the mind map with a friend and you should both
            see any changes the other person makes in real time.

            Don't expect it to work too well I made it for fun and as an
            excuse to play with various technologies. But if you do want to
            tell me about a particularly annoying bug, ask for a feature or
            want the source it's on github
            <a href="https://github.com/mbirtwell/mikes-mindmaps">here</a>.
            And discovering that someone has actually used this might very
            well spur me on to fix it.
