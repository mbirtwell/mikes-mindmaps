Mike's Mind Maps
================

A collaborative mind map creation tool [here](http://mikes-mindmaps.herokuapp.com/)

There's a big green button to create a mind map.
Share the URL of the mind map with a friend and you should both
see any changes the other person makes in real time.

Don't expect it to work too well I made it for fun and as an
excuse to play with various technologies. But if you do want to
tell me about a particularly annoying bug, ask for a feature try
raising an issue and discovering that someone has actually found
and used this might spur me on to fix it.
